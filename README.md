# AnyDB

This was an attempt at making a [Memento Database](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.luckydroid.droidbase) open-source alternative.

I only really got the Data layer, but it should be done for most functionality. I should draw a diagram, it's a little confusing, but allow for basically any data to be stored.

Would love to resurrect this project one day, or see it forked and developed.
